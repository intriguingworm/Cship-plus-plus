# Cship-plus-plus 

This is an almost battleship-esque game I made in C++ that follows a similar ruleset to battleship.

# Rules

1. You as the player have your own coordinate that you choose at the start, in which the enemy has to guess, while at the same time, you have to try and guess the enemy's coordinates.
2. Coordinates are on a 3x3 grid, each square is labeled A-C, and 1-3, an example of a coordinate would be A2, or B3.
